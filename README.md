# obesity_and_food_insecurity_in_the_US
This project analyzes how different levels of food insecurity in the US (low income and low food access, as well as just low food access) affects obesity rates across different states and years. It also includes an analysis on how different demographics and poverty affect both of these variables. The shiny folder contains my code for the Shiny application, while the RMD file contains most of my data analysis and cleaning.
